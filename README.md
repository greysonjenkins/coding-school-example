# coding-school-example

This page is meant to serve as a very basic introduction into the fundamentals if HTML/CSS for students at The Coding School. Students chose the theme, content, colors, layout, and more, in addition to creating their own personal websites.

The site can be viewed [here](https://the-coding-school.glitch.me).

*I'd like to apologize in advance for using a marquee tag. I know it was deprecated in HTML5, but the students totally loved it.*
