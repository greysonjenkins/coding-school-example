# coding-school-example

This site served as a basic introduction to the fundamentals of HTML/CSS for students attending The Coding School at A.E. Wright  Middle School in Calabasas, CA, for their second semester (Winter 2020) of Intro to Web Development. It was a one-hour class held on Wednsesdays after school.

Students chose the theme, content, colors, layout, and more, in addition to creating their own personal websites.

The site can be viewed [here](https://the-coding-school.glitch.me).

*I'd like to apologize in advance for using a marquee tag. I know it was deprecated in HTML5, but the students totally loved it.*
